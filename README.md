# Refined SIMD

Refined SIMD is an extension mod to Refined Storage which adds multiple utility blocks which you can add to your Refined Storage network. This mod is currently only supported in Minecraft 1.12.2. This is a free time project of mine to enhance my personal game play experience. Therefore, I do not plan on further supporting this code base. If you want to support the code or update it to a newer version please feel free to fork this repository.

## Installation

This mod uses the Minecraft forge mod loader. To Install the mod drop the build .jar file into the mods/ folder.

## Usage

Here is a list of blocks added with a description what they do

### 1. Remote Crafter / Pattern Chest

The Remote Crafter is a crafter which can use all crafting patters which are inside a liked pattern chest. Right-click the remote crafter onto the patter chest to link them.

### 2. Combined Exporter / Combined Importer

The Combined Exporter and Combined Importer are variants of the normal Exporter and Importer which can handle both items and fluids at the same time.
